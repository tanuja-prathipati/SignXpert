# SignXpert
This project develops a scalable solution for Indian Sign Language (ISL) communication by utilizing advanced speech-to-text APIs and predefined word-to-sign mappings. Implemented in Python, it effectively translates spoken language into visual ISL gestures, bridging communication gaps for the deaf community. By converting spoken words into corresponding sign images based on a predefined dictionary, the system promotes accessible and seamless interactions for ISL users, highlighting the potential of technology to enhance communication for the deaf community.
