# SignXpert
This project aims to develop a scalable solution for Indian Sign Language (ISL) communication, utilizing speech-to-text APIs and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Through machine learning, the system converts spoken language into ISL gestures. Implemented in Python, it bridges communication gaps for deaf individuals, with future plans for mobile/web integration and enhanced analysis.

The project architecture utilizes Python with PyAudio for audio input. Google Speech API converts audio to text, followed by NLP for semantic analysis.
